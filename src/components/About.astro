      Greetings! I blur the lines of creativity and tech to produce captivating
      and interactive websites. My background in hospitality prepares me for
      fast-paced and demanding work environments, where I excel at juggling
      tasks and collaborating with team members to bridge the client-consumer
      divide. On my days off, you can find me exploring new coffee joints in
      Logan Square or taking a scenic bike ride along the 606 trail.
